				As a PhD Candidate, my research focuses on large scale power outages and investment decisions in the utility industry. I collected data from the U.S Department of Energy using Python (modules I used include Beautifulsoup, Pandas). Given that the data was messy, I spent significant amount of time cleaning the data and preprocessing it using tools such as Regex, Fuzzywuzzy. I modelled investor reaction using a financial econometric technique called an Event Study. 
					In my free time, I work as a volunteer analyst with Data for Democracy
